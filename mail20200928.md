Dear course participant,

We would like to welcome you to the BioSB Machine Learning for Bioinformatics & Systems Biology course (https://pdmoerland.github.io/BioSB-MachineLearning-2020, 5-9 October). This year, the course will take place on-line due to COVID-19. We understand that this is not an ideal setup, but we are confident that with a bit of extra patience and effort from all of us we can still have a productive and useful course. We would like to share some information with you regarding the course setup and logistics.

Schedule and on-line setup
Each course day will have the following schedule:

9.00 - 12.00 Lecture and/or computer lab
12.00 - 13.00 Lunch break
13.00 - 17.00 Lecture and/or computer lab

As onIine platform we are going to use Discord. Please make sure to download (https://discord.com/download) and install the desktop application before the start of the course. We will send more details on how we will use Discord during the course later this week.

*Course material* 
The course material is already available (but might still be subject to some changes) at https://pdmoerland.github.io/BioSB-MachineLearning-2020/#course-material. In the attachment you can also find a self-evaluation test on linear algebra and probability theory, as well as some primers. Please have a short look at these before the course starts; we will only briefly go over the main topics on the first day.

*Matlab*
The computer labs will make extensive use of Matlab. You do not need to be a fluent programmer, but if you have never worked with Matlab before it may help to have a look at the Appendices of the computer lab manual (see course website). An extensive Matlab primer is also available there. 

If you do not have access to a Matlab campus license, install the 30-day free trial for Machine Learning (https://nl.mathworks.com/campaigns/products/trials/targeted/mal.html). When indicating which toolboxes to install, you should at least select the Deep Learning toolbox and the Statistics and Machine Learning toolbox.

Attendance
Instead of the usual sign-up sheet, we ask you to send all the scripts you wrote during the computer lab sessions at the end of the course to Perry Moerland (p.d.moerland@amsterdamumc.nl).

We are looking forward to seeing you on Discord! Please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me if you have further questions.
Perry Moerland
