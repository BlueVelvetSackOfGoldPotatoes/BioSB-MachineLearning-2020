Dear course participant,

As promised here are some more details on how we will use Discord during the course and a brief reminder on Matlab.

**Discord**
- As online platform we are going to use Discord. Please make sure to download (https://discord.com/download) and install the desktop application before the start of the course. 
- Use the invitation link to get access to the BIOSB ML course server.
- The course server contains multiple channels. The ‘Lecture room’ is the main channel where the lectures will be given. Please go there (just by clicking on it) and join the meeting at the start of each course day.
- Join at least 15 minutes early (that is, 8.45am) on Monday to ensure that everything works for you.
- During the lectures, make sure you are muted unless you want to ask a question. As much as possible, keep your camera on so that we can actually get to know each other.
- On the first day we’ll explain how we are going to use the other channels for the computer labs.

**Matlab**
- If you do not have access to a Matlab campus license, install the 30-day free trial for Machine Learning (https://nl.mathworks.com/campaigns/products/trials/targeted/mal.html). When indicating which toolboxes to install, you should at least select the Deep Learning toolbox and the Statistics and Machine Learning toolbox. Also when using a campus license you should have access to these two toolboxes.
- Please install Matlab and the two toolboxes before the start of the course, since downloading and installing will take a while.
- You can gain some more time if you already download and install the data and additional toolboxes available on the course website (https://pdmoerland.github.io/BioSB-MachineLearning-2020/website/Data_and_code.zip). Just unzip the file and then run the prstartup.m script. 

See you next week, have a nice weekend!

Perry
